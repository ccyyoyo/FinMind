# Project Overview

**FinMind-Arena** is a virtual investment advisory team composed of multiple domain-specialized AI agents. By combining structured debate, consensus-building, and multi-source financial intelligence, the system delivers single-stock investment assessments and actionable Buy / Hold / Sell recommendations.

## Vision
- Deliver autonomous, high-confidence equity research powered by AI collaboration.
- Capture diverse analytical perspectives (fundamental, technical, news, social sentiment).
- Provide transparent debate trails and rationales for each investment decision.

## Core Outputs
- ðŸ“Š Final investment recommendation with confidence ratings.
- ðŸ’¬ Agent positions, debate transcripts, and consensus summary.
- ðŸ“‰ Key indicators, charts, and contextual data visualizations.
- ðŸ“„ Exportable reports (PDF / web dashboard) for sharing insights.

## End-to-End Experience
1. **Request Intake** â€“ A user selects a target ticker and desired analysis window.
2. **Data Refresh** â€“ The ingestion layer fetches the most recent market, fundamental, news, and social signals, then normalizes them.
3. **Agent Deliberation** â€“ Specialized agents reason over curated data, debate their perspectives, and negotiate a consensus with the orchestrator.
4. **Insight Delivery** â€“ The system packages the recommendation, supporting evidence, and visualization assets for presentation in the UI or exported report.

This closed feedback loop ensures that each new request benefits from both fresh data and lessons learned from prior debates stored in the retrieval-augmented memory.
